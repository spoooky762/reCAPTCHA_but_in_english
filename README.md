A burp plugin that automatically recognizes graphic verification codes and uses them for Payload in Intruder.
use

Install:

    from here (https://github.com/bit4woo/reCAPTCHA/releases). Download the plugin
    Add it to burp. If you encounter no errors, you will see a new tab called "reCAPTCHA".

Prepare:

    Access the login interface of the target website through the burp proxy.

    Find the request to obtain the graphic verification code in the proxy, select it, right-click and select "Send to reCAPTCHA", and the information of this request will be sent to reCAPTCHA.

    Send to ![Send to](doc/Send_to.png) 

    Switch to the reCAPTCHA tab and configure the required parameters. When the parameters are configured, you can click the "Request" button to test the configuration.

    The API of http://www.ysdm.net is the only supported interface at present. You need to register an account and fill in the parameters yourself before you can successfully call the interface to complete the image recognition. The parameters required by the API are as follows. Please replace %s with the correct value, and pay special attention to the setting of typeid value ( http://www.ysdm.net/home/PriceType).

    username=%s&password=%s&typeid=%s

Use in Intruder:

After completing the configuration and testing successfully, you can now use the payload generated by the plugin in Intruder. There are two cases: username or password + verification code; username + password + verification code;

Case 1 : Only the password or only the username needs to be changed. We can use Pitchfork mode to configure.

For example, if it is known that there is a user admin in the system, to crack the user, the insertion point is marked as follows:

![index_condition1_mark](doc/index_condition1_mark.png)

payload 1 We load it from the file, needless to say.

payload 2 Select "Extension-Generated".

![index_condition1_mark_payload2](doc/index_condition1_mark_payload2.png)

The operation effect is as follows:

![index_condition1](doc/index_condition1.png)

**Scenario 2**: Both username and password need to be changed, this is a little more complicated. We still use Pichfork mode, but we need to label the username and password as an insertion point together. Like this:![img](doc/index_mark.png)

payload 1 Use Custom iterator. And combine username and password in the iterator.

In this example, position 1 is the user name, position 2 is "&j_password=", and position 3 is the password.

![index1](doc/index1.png)

The configuration of payload 2 is exactly the same as that of situation 1.

The operation effect is shown in the figure:

### FAQ
1. Error about "Response cannot be null"
~~The plugin uses burp's request function. If the prompt "Response cannot be null", it means that burp cannot access the request. Please check your network status and other timeout settings, this problem cannot be completely solved. ~~
Please try to enable the "Use Self Api with proxy" option and set proxy as a burp proxy. Then try again. You can view the request in burp history to troubleshoot problems.
